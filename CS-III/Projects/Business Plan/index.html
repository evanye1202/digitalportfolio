      <h1 class="text"> Identity </h1>
      <p class="text"> Our mission is to be able to convert code from one language to another. Our first test will be a Swift to C++ conversion that covers the basic functions.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> Problem </h1>
      <p class="text"> Code conversion is a time consuming process because every language is different. The main reason behind code conversion is that some languages can be faster than others. For example, JavaScript and Python are perfect for writing programs, however they can slow down with the complexity of the program. However, C++ complies code directly and is much faster, but can be hard to read or learn. As a result, developers end up having to use slower languages. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> Solution </h1>
      <p class="text"> Our solution will be making a software that translates languages into more complex but faster languages. Our product will be on a website that lets users input a text file or file type of the language. For the base product, we will start with conversions from Swift to C++. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> Target Market </h1>
      <p class="text"> Our audience will be programmers that want to increase the speed of their code by translating languages. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> Competition </h1>
      <p class="text"> Although there are a few code converters out there, many aren't fully functioning and don't convert all the languages. Much of the code is changed such as variable names, and can make the translated code look completely different compared to the original, so we will try to improve on the flaws of these converters. </p>
    </div>

   <div class="coursebox">
     <h1 class="text"> Revenue </h1>
     <p class="text"> Our plans for revenue is to place ads on the website or have fundraising events. </p>
   </div>

   <div class="coursebox">
     <h1 class="text"> Marketing Activities </h1>
     <p class="text"> We'll pay for and create advertisements when the product is nearly finished. Google Ads can promote our services on other platforms so the website can reach our target audience. </p>
     
   </div>
   <div class="coursebox">
     <h1 class="text"> Expenses </h1>
     <p class="text"> For now, the only form of expenses will be paying for advertisements. If there are ads, the ad rate would be capped at $20 a month and we will also try using GoDaddy or entering a payment plan costing $7 a month if we want our website off of the CoderMerlin server. </p>
   </div>
   <div class="coursebox">
     <h1 class="text"> Team and Key Roles </h1>
     <p class="text"> We have four team members at the current moment, but we are planning to recruit others. The members include: Evan Ye, Neeraj Gogate, Vivek Maranangit, and Karthik Peravali. Each team member will work on both backend and frontend but as the project continues towards completion, roles will be better defined. </p>
   </div>
   
   <div class="coursebox">
     <h1 class="text"> Milestones </h1>
     <p class="text"> As our project grows, we'll move onto support for other languages and expand on more advanced functions such as libraries or dictionaries. </p>
