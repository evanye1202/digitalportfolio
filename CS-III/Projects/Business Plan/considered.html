     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because I find it relatable in my own life, and so I thought it would be helpful. Whenever I go out with my friends, everytime we end up with the question of choosing where to eat. Because of this, the restaurant picker seemed convenient and useful for friend groups such as mine. However, I ended up rejecting this proposal because there are already many products like this one on apps like Google maps that find restaurants for you.</p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Eagle Card  </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because the idea of having a card that opens a Safari or Google tab on your phone sounded unique. However, I rejected this proposal because I realized that having to carry around a card at all times would be annoying. Not only is it another item to have on you, but the chances of losing a card is high. In addition, I realized making a technological device just to simply open tabs on your phone seemed like too much work, and searching up the website won't take much time either. </p>

     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because I enjoy creating playable games, and testing it while the game is in its developing stage is even better. However, I've already created many games in the past year, and I even created one for my Computer Science II ISP, so I didn't want to do another game. For this year's ISP, I wanted to create something that was useful, and I realized that a game wouldn't be very useful.</p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Social Media Bot </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because I agree that social media should be filled with content that the user wants. If social media didn't do this, then the user would easily get bored and move on, but social media that has what the user wants is captivating. However, I realized that many apps already have their own self regulating system. Apps such as Instagram, Twitter, or even TikTok all regulate content based on what the user clicks or interacts with.</p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brayden-edington/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> RFID Labels </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> Throughout the school year, I've seen many students getting pulled aside for not having their student ID. Because of this, there are more guards in the halls now and many are checking for IDs. I considered this proposal because I think that having guards only checking for IDs is too much, and an automated system would make it easier on the guards. However, I rejected this proposal because I don't see how this idea is realistic. The school would have to pay for extra systems that might be ineffective. This system detects if a student has the ID when they walk into the building, but there's no way it would know if the ID truly belongs to the student because there's no face recognition system. Because of this, it's easy for students to just bring IDs that don't even belong to them into the building. </p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Scheduling Website </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because as a student myself, I need to be organized with my schedule and keep track of what I need to get done each day. With a organizing app, the user can make a calendar and list tasks that need to be done on certain times or days of the week. However, I rejected this proposal because there's already apps out there that to do this. Even basic apps on the iPhone like the calendar or reminders app can replicate this organizer app already, and making another app to do this wouldn't seem that useful.</p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/daniel-joung/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Club Organizer </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> As a student who wants to join more clubs or get more service hours, I see a club organizer being helpful. Instead of looking around in school to find clubs or asking teachers how to get service hours, this website would make it easier for students by making it all available in one place. However, I ended up rejecting this idea because there are already apps out there in the school that do this. For example, the Allen ISD website itself already has a list of clubs that describe what it does and leads to the club websites. On x2vol, there are also many job opportunities listed on the website that you can sign up for.</p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/david-ortega/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Therapy Questionnaire </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> I considered this proposal because I think the idea of a self therapy questionnaire would be helpful in relieving stress. It would be useful because it would help understand one's problems. However, I ended up rejecting this proposal as I realized that these self therapy questions should not replace actual therapists with years of education and experience and shouldn't be relied on too much. People might also be misleaded into thinking that this website allows them to self diagnose themselves.                                         </p>

     <p class="text"> Every year and every day in high school, I have to buy school lunch because I never bring lunch from home, so I understand the situation with the lunch lines. I considered this proposal because like every other student that's been through the lunch lines, I wanted a faster system of getting lunch so I can spend more time eating rather than getting food. However, I quickly realized that having an online ordering system isn't ideal. It still requires making the food and having the staff preparing the food for students, and might even be more stressful because students have to pick up the food and there may be a need for additional staff to maintain the system. Because this system seems like it would speed up the lunch process, more students may end up using it and cause ordering to be even longer.   </p>

     <h1 class="text"> <a href="index.html">  Code Converter (Accepted Proposal) </a> </h1>
     <p class="text"> As a student interested in computer science, I know the difficulties of learning new languages. In my first year of computer science, I learned how to program in Swift, but in later years I would have to self teach myself new languages such as C++, and I found it more complex and harder to understand. This year, during the optimal sorting project with a team, we coded it in Swift, but found it to be slower than more complex languages such as C++. Because of this, we wanted to convert to C++ in order to get a faster time. However, this ended up not working and we had to stick with Swift. After this, I realized the need for code converters. By having an application that converts slow languages to fast and more complex languages, developers can compile code directly with languages like C++ and not have to worry about learning a completely new language. </p>
