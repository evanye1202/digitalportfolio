      <h1 class="text">(Software) Development Engineer </h1>
      <p class="text">There are two development engineers: front end and back end. The front end will work on the front end of the website, which is what the customer sees and uses. The back end will work on the back end, which is the code that gives the functionality of the website. I know I'll be best suited for front end engineer. This is because I have experience making websites already and have also been a front end engineer in a large team in last year's Arena Scheduling website. The only challenges I see is that I might have trouble remembering how to use HTML and CSS to my best potential and will have to learn some of it again. </p>

      <h1 class="text">QA Engineer </h1>
      <p class="text">A quality assurance engineer makes sure the code is good quality and has no errors. They usually create tests that find issues with software before the product is complete for use. I think I would be a good quality assurance engineer because I always look for errors in my code and look for ways on how to improve the code. Even when the website looks finished, I always take time to look for bugs and report them to my team. A challenge could be that I wouldn't know how to solve it by myself if the error was in the back end of the project, but I would just collaborate with the back end team to overcome this challenge.</p>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Project Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">A project manager is in charge of the software and the roles of each member. They also know the strengths of each member so the roles are assigned accordingly. I don't think I'd be a good fit for this role because I don't have the skills of a leader and it would take time for me to get comfortable with my teammates. If I wanted to occupy this role, I would have to completely understand every role, which would be time consuming for me and I would have less time working on my own assignments.</p>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Product Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">The product manager is in charge of managing the team so the best possible product can be produced. They also prioritize what the customers want and implement that into the product. I have potential of being a decent product manager because I always think of how people will react to what I make, so I will have ideas of what the customers want. I can also communicate with my team members on my ideas, but I don't think I have the skills of a leader, so that could be a challenge. To overcome this, I'll get comfortable with each of my teammates by collaborating with them more, and then I won't be scared of leading them. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 clas="text">Release Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">The release manager does the git branching and organizes the flow of code. If there is a big mess of code, the release manager will clean this up and should also know which file affects other files. I believe that I could be a decent release manager. This is because I'm always organized in both real life and in my code, so I'll know where everything belongs. A challenge for me would be to understand everything about git branching, but I can watch tutorials online or look up how it works.</p>
