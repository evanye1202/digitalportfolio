      <p class="text"> </p> Some issues I had was that after I pulled from the main branch, I no longer had access to the website due to security reasons. After fixing that, I created a new page for the about and help. I added the general layout to both, and will work on adding content next week.

      <p class="text"> A technical challenge I had this week was that I didn't know how to create a drop down menu, so I had to look up a YouTube tutorial in order to do it. In the drop down menu, I would make it so that there's multiple options of languages to choose from. For now, we only have a Swift option, but in the future, we will focus on adding more languages.</p>

      <h1 class="text">Technical Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text"> Some technical challenges was that the front end team had to figure out how to get editing rights for the repository. As a result, the front end has made less progress than the back end and the front end is not behind schedule. To help solve this, the front end began working on a shared repository to collaborate and make progress together.</p>

 <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Scheduling Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text"> The only scheduling challenge is that the front end is a bit behind, but that's not a major issue because the front end isn't the part that should be focused on the most, but rather the back end. In the future, the front end will work on refining everything, but for now, we just need a basic template to get work started.

      <p class="text">A technical challenge we had was that our Github issues weren't working correctly. Although we created issues, it wasn't appearing correctly, but after communicating with the teacher and with each other on Discord, we found a solution to correct it.</p>

      <h1 class="text">Interpersonal Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text"> An interpersonal challenge we had this week was the creation of a front end template for the website. Our team was split in half, with three working on the front end, with myself being included. I and two other team members had to create templates, and we debated ideas against each other. In the end, we were able to join a Discord voice call and choose a template.

      <h1 class="text">Technical Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text">There are a few technical challenges right now, especially because our team is just starting on the project. The most major one right now for me is that I'm not completely familiar with HTML and CSS anymore, and will need to review them. Making a code converting website such as this is much more complex than a simple digital portfolio, and I will need to research ways to make better designs after being familiar with the syntax again.  </p>
    </div>
 <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Scheduling Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text">Some scheduling challenges I can see right away is that not everyone can work together at the same time. Because there are 6 of us, there’s not a high chance of everyone being available at the same time. To overcome this challenge, we split the team of 6 into two teams of 3, where one team works on the front end of the website and the other team works on the back end.
      </p>
 </div>
  <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Interpersonal Challenges </h1>
      <p class="text">Some possible interpersonal challenges could be motivation and collaboration levels. Not everyone has the same level of motivation and it can be hard to keep up with team members that have much more knowledge, which can lead to a team member that has lower knowledge having less motivation and not working with the team.

      <h1 class="text">(Software) Development Engineer </h1>
      <p class="text">There are two development engineers: front end and back end. The front end will work on the front end of the website, which is what the customer sees and uses. The back end will work on the back end, which is the code that gives the functionality of the website. I know I'll be best suited for front end engineer. This is because I have experience making websites already and have also been a front end engineer in a large team in last year's Arena Scheduling website. The only challenges I see is that I might have trouble remembering how to use HTML and CSS to my best potential and will have to learn some of it again. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">QA Engineer </h1>
      <p class="text">A quality assurance engineer makes sure the code is good quality and has no errors. They usually create tests that find issues with software before the product is complete for use. I think I would be a good quality assurance engineer because I always look for errors in my code and look for ways on how to improve the code. Even when the website looks finished, I always take time to look for bugs and report them to my team. A challenge could be that I wouldn't know how to solve it by myself if the error was in the back end of the project, but I would just collaborate with the back end team to overcome this challenge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Project Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">A project manager is in charge of the software and the roles of each member. They also know the strengths of each member so the roles are assigned accordingly. I don't think I'd be a good fit for this role because I don't have the skills of a leader and it would take time for me to get comfortable with my teammates. If I wanted to occupy this role, I would have to completely understand every role, which would be time consuming for me and I would have less time working on my own assignments.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text">Product Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">The product manager is in charge of managing the team so the best possible product can be produced. They also prioritize what the customers want and implement that into the product. I have potential of being a decent product manager because I always think of how people will react to what I make, so I will have ideas of what the customers want. I can also communicate with my team members on my ideas, but I don't think I have the skills of a leader, so that could be a challenge. To overcome this, I'll get comfortable with each of my teammates by collaborating with them more, and then I won't be scared of leading them. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 clas="text">Release Manager </h1>
      <p class="text">The release manager does the git branching and organizes the flow of code. If there is a big mess of code, the release manager will clean this up and should also know which file affects other files. I believe that I could be a decent release manager. This is because I'm always organized in both real life and in my code, so I'll know where everything belongs. A challenge for me would be to understand everything about git branching, but I can watch tutorials online or look up how it works.</p>
