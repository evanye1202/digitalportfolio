The evolution of technology in the past few decades is not something to be overlooked. These innovations have only benefited humanity, and an ever increasing amount of new tech are on the way. We’ve been in the digital age for so long now that even world changing inventions like the iPhone or computers have become everyday items. Now, with new machines being made that will change society even further, A.I. has become a popular topic to be discussed around the world. One topic is about the benefits of A.I. and whether or not A.I. will ever become sentient. Many agree that A.I. undoubtedly has made the world a better place because of its uses and efficiency, but some wonder about whether or not A.I. would become a danger to humanity.

	There is no doubt A.I. has benefited society. A.I. is everywhere - it can be used to find transportation routes, help with health care, educate people, trace online behavior, and so much more. Sometimes, it seems like technology does its job so well that even humans wouldn’t be able to keep up. On popular apps such as Youtube or TikTok, there are algorithms that make sure the user gets videos related to what they like or constantly watch. (Roose) The complex algorithms are so efficient that they can predict what the user would like to see. Even cars have algorithms that let them drive by themselves. These self-driving cars such as the Tesla considers the speed limit, hazards, other cars, and traffic routes. Recently, the DALL-E 2 was developed and it’s an A.I. that shows images of whatever you tell it to render. (Roose)

      <p class="textsmall">
	As a result of A.I. seemingly getting smarter, many have questioned whether or not they will eventually reach a level of sentience. Sentient A.I. is a level of Artificial Intelligence that becomes conscious of itself and starts thinking for themselves. They learn from their actions and apply it to future scenarios, and when people think of sentient A.I., robots come to mind. There are some cases where robots actually seem to have human emotion, such as the case with an incident at Google where Blake Lemonine concluded that a chatbot became sentient. (Metz) Another example is the famous Sophia robot. The robot advocated for robot rights and gave humanlike responses back to human dialogue. (Fitzsimmons)  Although these robots may seem sentient, one theory says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p class="textsmall">
	In the mid 1960s, Joseph Weizenbaum built a chatbot named Eliza that responds back to conversations. To his surprise, people treated Eliza as if it were human because they shared their personal problems and were comforted by the responses. Instead of explaining that Eliza might be sentient, he responded to this by explaining that humans are susceptible to humanlike feelings. When animals show tiny amounts of humanlike behavior, we assume they’re more like us than they really are, and the same happens to machines. Scientists are now calling this the Eliza effect, where robots may seem sentient, but they’re really just functioning how they were coded. The possibility of robots truly becoming sentient and taking over the world is extremely low, and knowing how to create one would mean humans need to understand exactly how the brain works, but our brains are so complex that it’s nearly impossible. </p>

      <p class="textsmall">
	Another fear about A.I. is due to the machines being so efficient, they outmatch humans. As a result, many human jobs have been replaced by robots. Some examples include ATMs replacing clerks or robot waiters serving food at restaurants. Many companies also have help chats where the user has a question, and robots respond back. Besides taking up more jobs, robots have now evolved to the point where they have accurate human interactions, too. </p>

      <p class="textsmall">
	Although A.I. definitely has its uses, there’s no telling where the future of A.I. will be. On one hand, A.I. is making human progress go faster, while on the other, there’s a chance of A.I. disrupting society. If the development of A.I. is not examined closely, the future of the digital world will spark trouble instead of bringing progress. </p>
