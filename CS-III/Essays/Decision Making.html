	&emsp; &emsp; Every day, we have to make decisions, whether it be an influential or minor one. Either way, whenever we make a decision, we process through all the possibilities of what might or might not happen, and this impacts what we choose. Because of this, outside factors easily impact our choices, and these outside factors lead to decision bias. In this case, the decisions I’m talking about are the choices I’ll make to progress in my ISP with my team. Our goal of creating a website that allows developers to translate easier coding languages to more complex and more efficient languages will require lots of decision making, and the possibilities of biases when making these choices are high.

	  &emsp; &emsp; Everyone has gone through a time when they were low on time to complete an assignment, whether it be finishing homework, a project, or even accomplishing a goal. As a result, we tend to overlook important things to get the assignment done as soon as possible. However, by only focusing on finishing quickly, this brings out the potential of biases such as the feature positive bias (Wilcot). The feature positive bias is when teams tend to focus on all the benefits of their product and ignore whatever negative effects are on it. In our case, if our team gets low on time and won’t be able to meet the project deadline, there’s a high chance we’ll decide to try to get all the main functions completed even if it means ignoring the bugs on the website. Our website would have its main goal of translating code, but our website could be hard to navigate or sometimes not work at all, but as long as we accomplished what we wanted to, these problems would not seem important. However, this obviously is important and we need to get around this bias. To solve this, instead of trying to get the entire project done as soon as possible, I think my team should focus on one portion of the website at a time until it’s perfected, and only then can we move onto the next part. Another bias our team might have if we run low on time is the loss aversion bias. This bias becomes a high possibility when a team makes a crucial decision and tries to stick to it no matter what happens. However, they later realize there’s better solutions, but instead of choosing those solutions, they still stick with their original plan in fear of losing all their progress (Wilcot). This has a high possibility of happening especially because my team is coding everything. Whenever developers spend hours of their time on code, they would likely not get rid of everything and start from scratch just because they thought of a better solution. To solve this, my team would have to brainstorm many possibilities of completing our project and work together to figure out the best solution to create the most efficient website. </p>

	&emsp; &emsp; Not all biases will come from time management. Oftentimes, it can come from the team dynamics. Three possible biases that can come out of this are the authority bias, action bias, and bandwagon bias. (Wilcot) In most teams, there’s usually one that’s the most experience that decides to step up and lead the team. This is known as authority bias, and it means that they choose most of the ideas, and since they’re the leader, they can trump or better other ideas, leading to less creative and efficient problem solving. To solve this problem, my team should have everyone communicating and working together to figure out problems, and split work equally so no one falls behind on improving their skills. Relating to the authority bias, the bandwagon bias can come as an effect from the authority bias. Since the authority person chooses most of the ideas, many people just go along with it because they think their ideas will get rejected. To fix this problem on our team, we must hear out every team member’s ideas and choose the ones that they most agree with. Finally, the last bias, action bias, doesn’t come from the authority, but rather comes from themselves. When team members feel like they need to get involved in any way possible because they don’t know what to do, they feel the need to take action regardless of whether it’s a good idea or not. To solve this problem, again, work must be split equally and every team member has to share their ideas if they have any to the entire team. </p>

      <p class="textsmall">
	&emsp; &emsp; With biases affecting the ISP, my team and I need to be careful on the decisions we make. Each idea needs to be shared and each decision must be agreed on by most of the team. If we had less biases then our project won't have as many errors in it. In order for us to create the best website to translate code, we must reduce bias as much as possible. </p>
