      <h1 class="text"> Concept </h1>
      <p class="text"> My team's ISP project concept is supposed to be a horror game where you play in a work simulator in order to get a job and pay rent. At the end of the game, you need enough money to win the game, and the game has choices that impact your outcome. The game takes place in many settings and in both day and night. </p>

	  <h1 class="text"> Motivation </h1>
	  <p class="text"> My team's primary motivation came from our own interests. We all love anything related to horror and making a horror game sounded interesting. Before this project, we also worked on a scheduling website and in this website there was also a mini horror game and we had fun making that, so we decided to create a larger game with an actual game engine.

	  <div class="moneycodebox">
	    <p class="text"> This part of our game's code is a simple yet effective money system. The PlayerPrefs.HasKey needs to detect whether or not the player has gotten the money condition after completing a job, and will reward the player with 150 dollars if the job was successful. PlayerPrefs.GetInt gets the player's original money value and adds additional money to this integer, and then stores the value for later use. </p>

	  <img id="pause" src="pause.PNG">
	  <div class="pausecodebox">
	  <p class="text"> Our game also has a pausing system that stops the time in the game whenever the escape key is pressed. In the Resume() function, a pause menu is deactivated while the time begins again and the pause function activates the pause menu and stops time. </p>

	  <h1 class="text"> Conclusion </h1>
	  <p class="text"> Not all of the team knew how to use the game engine, Unity, or the 3D modeling app, Blender, so it was expected that it would take a few work days to learn these apps. However, there were many unexpected things such as us having little work time in class because only one of us could bring a laptop and with AP exams coming up, we had little time outside of class as well because lots of time went towards studying for those exams. Even though we did not have all the time we wanted, we were still proud with our finished result. </p>
