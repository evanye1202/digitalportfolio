      <h1 class="text"> Computer Science I </h1>
      <p class="text"> In my first year of computer science, I learned the programming language, Swift. I was taught the basic syntax of this language and ideas such as loops, conditions, and classes. Although I had prior experience with coding, I knew my skills improved after this course.</p>

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> Computer Science II </h1>
      <p class="text"> In this course, we used CSI's topics and applied them in more challenging applications such as recursive systems. This year, we were given more chances to work on group projects, and even collaborated with students in the CS3 class. Our class was also given the opportunity to simulate what a real world computer science project would look like by working in a large team and with different roles.  </p>

    <div class ="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> AP Calculus BC </h1>
      <p class="text"> I learned how to use calculus to solve math problems by learning what derivatives, antiderivatives, limits, series, and differential equations were.

    <div class="coursebox">
      <h1 class="text"> AP Physics 1 </h1>
      <p class="text"> Physics 1 taught me how to apply algebra to problem solve problems in kinematics, forces, circular motion, momentum, simple harmonic motion, and more.
