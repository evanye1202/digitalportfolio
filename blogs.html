    <h1>5-May-2023 Topic: AI Regulation of Government </h1>
    <p>
      Even though AI has further developed the world, I think that regulation of Ai by the government is necessary. The development of AI is still new, and the dangers and risks are unknown. AI may help increase efficiency of jobs and tasks, but there's also the possible risk of AIs replacing human jobs or being hard to control if not checked upon regularly. In other words, the development of AI can bring the possibility of AI being too strong. For example, there's new AI like ChatGPT being able to answer nearly question, AIs being able to create songs based on any singers' voices, and even Snapchat has implemented an AI similar to ChatGPT on its platform. This may be exciting right now as we can see just the tip of what AI can truly do, but in the near future, progress for AI will increase exponentially, and the government should keep a check on the latest ones being developed.
