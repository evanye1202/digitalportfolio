	<p id="abouttext" class="text">&emsp; &emsp; Hi, my name is Evan Ye and currently I am a senior at Allen High School. Some of my favorite hobbies are swimming, playing basketball or football, watching TV shows, playing video games, or coding. Since middle school, I've been interested in learning how to code and self learned many languages such as Python or Java. My first coding projects were creating small games. Creating games was what got me into coding because I enjoyed seeing my code working and creating what I wanted. In high school, I've taken Computer Science I and II and am now in Computer Science III. I have a deep passion for computer science and want to major in this field.</p>
